## Projects

### [Decision Trees](Machine-Learning/DecisionTrees/)
This project is a decision tree classifer that is used to classify syntheic data as well as Pokémon statisitcs. An easy-to-ready output is presented that describes the decision that was created.

### [Binary Classification Using Multilayer Perceptrons](Machine-Learning/MultilayerPerceptrons/)
In this project, I use the MNIST dataset to classify handwritten 0s and 1s as well as 0-9s. This MLP uses backpropagation to train the model, acheiving 99.95% accuracy for 0-1 classification and 98%+ for 0-9 classification.

### [Chracter Recurrent Neural Network on Shakesperean Text](Machine-Learning/TextGenerationRNN/)
Create new plays from Shakespeare! This project trains on a small set of Sharkesperean text to form a character-based RNN to generate text. This project made use of Python's PyTorch to implement this RNN.

### [Corgi Breed Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks](Machine-Learning/ImageClassificationCNN/)
Given any of the two breeds of corgis, pembroke or cardigan, this model will predict the breed based on your image! This project makes use of PyTorch to implement a convolutional neural network to train and test on images of corgis.

### [Megaminx A* Puzzle Solver](Megaminx-Solver/)
Given any random state of a 12-sided Rubix cube-like puzzle, find optimal solutions using the A* algorithm. A text based gui is available for users to visualize the state of the puzzle.

### [Stock Analytics](stocks.py)
Given any random state of a 12-sided Rubix cube-like puzzle, find optimal solutions using the A* algorithm. A text based gui is available for users to visualize the state of the puzzle.
